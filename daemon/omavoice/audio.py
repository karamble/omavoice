"""Microphone in, speaker out — both through PipeWire's own CLI.

pw-record and pw-play in --raw mode speak exactly the format Kokoro and whisper
wants (PCM16, 24 kHz, mono), and they resample for us, so there is no audio
library here and nothing to build. Two long-lived subprocesses, one asyncio
task each.

The only subtle part is barge-in. When the person starts talking over the
assistant, the audio already handed to pw-play is committed — it will play out
of the buffer no matter what we stop sending. The only way to cut it off is to
kill the player and start a new one, which costs about 50 ms and is well worth
it: an assistant that keeps talking over you is the single thing that makes a
voice interface feel broken.

    So audio below a threshold is replaced with silence before it is ever sent.
    Replaced rather than dropped: the VAD wants an unbroken stream, and a gap

    talking distance and a display mic across the desk differ by more than an
    order of magnitude, and the echo canceller's noise suppression moves the
    floor again. Tuned for one, the same constant either answers the fan or
    swallows half a sentence — which is exactly what happened here.

    So the gate tracks the room's noise floor continuously and opens at a
    multiple of it. The floor falls quickly and rises slowly: speech should
    drag it up barely at all, while plugging in a different microphone should
    be forgotten within seconds. `OMAVOICE_GATE` still accepts a number for
