"""The daemon: wires the microphone, the Realtime session, the brain and the panel together.

State is a small machine, and the UI is a pure function of it:

    idle       nothing is happening; the panel is closed or waiting
    listening  the microphone is hot and the person may be speaking
    thinking   the local agent is working on a question
    speaking   an answer is coming out of the speakers
    error      something broke and the panel should say so

Audio only flows while a session is running, which starts when the panel opens
and stops when it closes. A voice assistant that keeps the microphone open when
you are not looking at it is not a thing worth building.
