"""Choosing which microphone to listen on and which speaker to answer through.

There is no single right answer, because the desk changes. A laptop lid holds
its microphone a hand's width from the mouth; a display holds one an arm's
length away and correspondingly quieter; earbuds hold one against the cheek.
The same sentence, recorded on this machine, transcribed as twenty-three words
through earbuds and as *"the weather."* through the display — nothing else
about the system differed.

So the choice is made per session, from the devices the system is actually
using, and the echo canceller is switched in or out with it:

  speakers      sound goes into the room, comes back into the microphone, and
                the assistant answers itself unless it is cancelled. Route both
                ends through the canceller.

  headphones    nothing reaches the room, so there is no echo to cancel — and
                the canceller's noise suppression, which costs signal, is pure
                loss here. Use the plain default devices.

Whether headphones are on is read from the sink the system chose: a Bluetooth
audio sink is worn by definition, and a wired one announces itself in the name
of its active port. Anything unrecognised is assumed to be a speaker, because
that assumption is the safe one — an unnecessary canceller costs a little
signal, while a missing one makes the assistant talk to itself.
