"""The brain: whatever actually answers the question.

The Realtime model is the voice and the ears. It knows how to hold a
conversation and nothing else — every question of fact goes through here, to a
local coding agent that can read this machine as well as the web.

Two backends, same contract. Both are asked to return JSON matching
schemas/answer.json, so the panel never has to parse prose:

    codex   `codex exec` on the ChatGPT subscription. Native --output-schema,
            so the shape is enforced by the CLI. Held to the chosen folder by
            a permission profile — not by --sandbox, which bounds writes only.
    claude  `claude -p` with the schema pressed into the prompt. More
            integrations (skills, MCP), no schema enforcement, so we repair.

Conversation continuity is per-backend: the first ask of a session starts a
thread, later asks resume it, so "и что там во втором файле?" means something.
